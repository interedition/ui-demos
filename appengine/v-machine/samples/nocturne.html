<h4>Textual Notes</h4>
<div class="note">
<em class="label">critical:</em> There are three TS versions of this poem entitled
                    'Nocturne, Saint Eloi, 1918'. It was nocturne_poemslished as 'Nocturne, Saint Eloi, 1929'
                    in The Irish Statesman, II:4 (28 September 1929) 69, under the pseudonym L.
                    Saint Senan (See 'Saint Senan's Well'). 'Nocturne' was written in late 1928 or
                    early 1929. To the editor's knowledge, it has not been reprinted.<hr>
</div>
<div class="note">
<em class="label">biographical:</em> During World War I, MacGreevy served for
                    twenty-two months as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, spending
                    most of that time in the front line of the Somme (after the war he was promoted
                    to the rank of lieutenant). In France he was wounded twice, the second time
                    (September 1918) more seriously at Commines, where he received a shoulder
                    wound. <hr>

<strong>Critical note:</strong>  
                        
                        <p>Saint Eloi, one of the most popular Saints of the Middle Ages,
                            founded a monastery near the present village of Mont St. Eloi, five miles
                            northwest of the city of Arras in northern France. The ruins of the monastery
                            remain, and in 1917-18 were close to the Western Front. There is also a British
                            Military Cemetery nearby.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Eloi may also be a reference to the words of Christ on the
                            cross: 'Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? . . . My God, my God, why hast thou
                            forsaken me?' (Mark 15:34-5).</p>

                                        academy at Bloomsbury in London, was MacGreevy's closest friend during the war.
                                        Both men were drafted to the same division in France. MacGreevy was assigned to
                                        guns, Taylor to trench mortars: 'the greatest misfortune that could befall a
                                        gunner-officer. Trench mortars were regarded with horror . . . [they were] a
