                  published poems were taken from MacGreevy's own copy of Poems (Heinemann, 1934). Manuscript copies are from MacGreevy's papers at Trinity College, Dublin (individual manuscript numbers

                                      twenty-two months as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, spending
                                      most of that time in the front line of the Somme (after the war he was promoted
                                      to the rank of lieutenant). In France he was wounded twice, the second time
                                      (September 1918) more seriously at Commines, where he received a shoulder
                                      wound.
