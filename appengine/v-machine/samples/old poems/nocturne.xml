                <note type="critical" anchored="true">There are three TS versions of this poem entitled
                    'Nocturne, Saint Eloi, 1918'. It was published as 'Nocturne, Saint Eloi, 1929'
                    in The Irish Statesman, II:4 (28 September 1929) 69, under the pseudonym L.
                    Saint Senan (See 'Saint Senan's Well'). 'Nocturne' was written in late 1928 or
                    early 1929. To the editor's knowledge, it has not been reprinted.</note> 
                
                <note type="biographical" anchored="true">During World War I, MacGreevy served for
                    twenty-two months as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, spending
                    most of that time in the front line of the Somme (after the war he was promoted
                    to the rank of lieutenant). In France he was wounded twice, the second time
                    (September 1918) more seriously at Commines, where he received a shoulder
                    wound. </note>
