<strong>Critical note:</strong> 
                  <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with  provide the
			 key to this very short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed
			 since Patrick Pearse had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post
			 Office. The country had seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of
			 Easter 1916, and this was followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918
			 election by an extended campaign of guerilla warfare against the British with
			 its reprisals and counter-reprisals.</p>
                  <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was
			 divided into bitterly opposing camps, and engaged in civil war over the terms
			 of the agreement reached in London in December 1921. The new national
			 institutions that emerged did so more through the passage of time than as the
			 expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem captures the
			 despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter political
			 divisions.</p>

<strong>Critical note: </strong>
                  <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with  provide the
			 key to this very short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed
			 since Patrick Pearse had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post
			 Office. The country had seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of
			 Easter 1916, and this was followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918
			 election by an extended campaign of guerilla warfare against the British with
			 its reprisals and counter-reprisals.</p>
                  <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was
			 divided into bitterly opposing camps, and engaged in civil war over the terms
			 of the agreement reached in London in December 1921. The new national
			 institutions that emerged did so more through the passage of time than as the
			 expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem captures the
			 despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter political
			 divisions.</p>
